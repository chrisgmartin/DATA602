Most of the files are homework files from the course, and homework/project support.

## Beatles Lyrics Project

The final project was a data mining and webscraping experiment to gather lyrics from The Beatles, using strangely formatted HTML sources.
Combining the lyrics with several other online sources (such as song meta data, the singers for each song, and album meta data), I found the most commonly used words by each artist (both sung and written) and used a fun graphic to create a wordcloud of the results.
