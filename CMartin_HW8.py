#This homework will give you a chance to explore some image processing techniques in Python.
#These are some of the most basic tasks done in image processing.

#First, download the image package attached to this lesson.
#On each image you will count the number of objects in the image and find their center points. 
#The images in order of complexity are circles.png, objects.png and peppers.png.

#Using Python's built-in functionality, scipy, or any other module, perform the following tasks:

#Thresholding:
#First convert the image to a binary image.
#This is done with a technique called thresholding, which is covered in the reading.
#There are functions for it in scipy, although it is very easy to do manually.
#Essentially read each pixel and if it above a specified gray level make it white, otherwise make it black.

def global_technique(image_url):
    newimg = misc.imread(image_url, mode='L')
    global_thresh = skif.threshold_otsu(newimg)
    global_cut = newimg > global_thresh
    return imshow(global_cut)

global_technique(circles_url)
global_technique(objects_url)
global_technique(peppers_url)


#Count objects:
#Count the number of objects in the image.
#If you are interested in how this is done, refer to the additional readings.
#An object will be a group of white pixels surrounded by black pixels.
#Doing this by hand is also fairly easy, but try to use functions found in the modules available.

def counter(image_url):
    newimg = misc.imread(image_url, mode='L')
    global_thresh = skif.threshold_otsu(newimg)
    labeled, nr_objects = mh.label(newimg > global_thresh)
    return nr_objects

counter(circles_url)
counter(objects_url)
counter(peppers_url)

#just out of curiosity
#how does the counter work with a gaussian filter
def clean_counter(image_url):
    newimg = misc.imread(image_url, mode='L')
    glimg = mh.gaussian_filter(newimg, 8)
    global_thresh = skif.threshold_otsu(newimg)
    labeled, nr_objects = mh.label(newimg > global_thresh)
    return nr_objects

clean_counter(circles_url)
clean_counter(objects_url)
clean_counter(peppers_url)

#Find center points:
#For each object, find the center point in terms of x,y coordinates.
#As with part 3, you can do this directly, but it's better to use something from a module.
#Image files can be read in directly or you can use a dialog box.
#Your output will list the objects and midpoints for each image.
#Remember, the focus here is to use readily available Python functions to do image processing rather
#than gain a deep understanding of the theory of the techniques.
#For the peppers.png image, Iâ€™m not expecting a specific number, as the answer is fairly subjective.
#The focus is on the process, not the result.
